# Brenn-Slow-LFO

![Brenn Photo](/Docs/Brenn-Photo.png)

100mm Quad Slow LFO

- 4 Lfo's
- Each has a cycle duration between a few seconds and a few minutes, approx 6 sec 12 minutes
- Each LFO has it's own speed control
- A single global speed control
- CV control for the global speed
- Each LFO has both unpolar and bipolar outputs

I have been using the lfo for slow evolving movement of sounds, it is not a replacement for a standard lfo

Contained are schematics & gerber files for pcb fabrication of both electrical and front panel. This is sutiable for entry level however a basic level of electronics, soldering, fault finding, and some basic tools are required.
